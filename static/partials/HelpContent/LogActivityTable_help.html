<h1 class="western" align="CENTER">Responsible Power’s Active Management Portal - AMP</h1>
<h2 class="western">Welcome</h2>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Welcome to your energy portal. This portal will cater for all your electrical analysis needs and should help you reduce power consumption throughout your hotel.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A large amount of electricity is wasted within hotels, and this leads to higher than necessary electricity bills. Typically, consumption rises between 6 and 9% per annum in the hospitality industry. This portal is here to help you to both reduce electricity consumption and reduction in the hotel electricity bill as well reducing your carbon footprint.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The portal will highlight where energy savings can be made during the day-to-day running of the hotel and by recording the number of visitors to each area of your hotel, (including Functions + Delegates, Leisure/Spa, Restaurant, Rooms-Sold + Sleepers.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Based on an in-depth consultation, visits to the hotel by an experienced energy engineer and analysis of your electrical circuits, a number of alerts have been set-up to guide you to instances of waste as they are happening. The portal will allow you to see the alerts and critically, the actions taken plus responses given by your staff in order to reduce the electricity consumption. These can be monitored to ensure timely responses are forthcoming following investigation by staff when the Email Alert is received.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The portal displays information for your benefit in separate information boxes called widgets. Each widget is described in detail below.</p>

<h4 class="western">Hotel Daily Statistics</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">This widget should be filled out daily by your night team, it allows the input of data for each of covers in the restaurant, rooms occupied, sleepers, functions, delegates and spa users for that day. Information can be easily input using the on the left hand side.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The statistics can be downloaded to Excel for your own records by clicking on the “Actions” button and exporting to .csv.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image1.png"><img class="wp-image-41233 aligncenter" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image1-300x177.png" alt="image1" width="454" height="268" /></a></p>

<h4 class="western">Hotel Statistics Chart</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The statistics entered each day are available for interrogation in the chart below. By selecting or deselecting the individual items in the key you can focus any investigation into trends in your Consumption.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">In general terms, the higher the ‘Total’ on each day the higher the Energy Consumption is likely to have been. That said, it is clear that some areas are higher consuming than others; you will quickly learn your site and be able to perhaps anticipate likely trends.</p>

<h4 class="western"> <a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image2.png"><img class=" wp-image-41234 aligncenter" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image2-300x98.png" alt="image2" width="462" height="151" /></a></h4>
<h4 class="western">Daily Comparison Chart</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The chart allows you to compare how busy each day has been, it is a general rule that if the hotel is busier than it should be consuming more electricity than if it was quiet. Using the Hotel Statistics Chart or Table will guide you as to how business was on each day; the data can be set up to be vertically above each-other to allow easy critique or analysis.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Each functional group is highlighted in a different colour to show how much energy they are using. Again, functions can be deselected or selected to explore any trends. By hovering over each coloured block the associated total is displayed in a pop-up window. For deeper understanding, should you need it, the energy consumed ‘1 week before’ and ‘1 year ago’ are displayed next to each day in your chosen date-range; they can be deselected if desired.</p>

<h4 class="western"> <a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image3.png"><img class="wp-image-41235 aligncenter" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image3-300x124.png" alt="image3" width="619" height="256" /></a></h4>
<h4 class="western">Daily Consumption Detail</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The daily cost of energy is displayed here, breakdown per functional group is with columns in tabular form. This should appear here by 10am each day to allow you to present these numbers to your team at your daily operations meeting and to build upon an energy saving strategy that involves all hotel employees. We also include the ‘Cost of the lowest overnight hour’ as a guide to how well the Hotel has been shutdown by the staff; we expand that into the ‘Annualised Waste Overnight’ to help you gauge the extent that this may erode Hotel Profits. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Large Red £</b></span> numbers are bad and the hotel should be aiming to achieve <span style="color: #00b050;"><b>£0</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"> every night unless there is a valid business reason for additional energy to have been required.</span></p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">By clicking on the “Actions” button on the upper right hand corner, you can view the “<span style="color: #0070c0;">Energy Consumption Graph</span>”, this shows the total cost of electricity of the hotel and a breakdown of each functional group. To show a single functional group on the graph, click on the acronyms in the key to remove those that you do not want to display.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_GoBack"></a> There is an option to print the graph under the THREE BAR icon and to Export the Data using the button.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">To toggle back to the Table use the Actions button.</p>

<h4 class="western">Daily Operations Meeting – Page to Print and Take</h4>
<p class="western">Each morning the Duty Manager must ensure that yesterday’s Energy Costs are taken into the Daily Operations Meeting. This is easily done via the ‘Daily Operations Meeting – Energy Detail’ option under the Actions button.</p>
<p class="western">This is self explanatory and should be delivered from top to bottom. Each HOD or department representative should be able to explain their numbers where required.</p>
<p class="western">The page details the Alerts Triggered and the responses generated; these are covered in a coming section.</p>
<p class="western">At the foot of the page there are the top 10 prioritised Energy Actions for the Hotel. These are unique to the hotel and are based upon our work with you and your energy consumption trends. They are covered in more detail below.</p>

<h4 class="western"></h4>
<h4 class="western">Triggered Alerts</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Based on an in-depth consultation, visits to the hotel by an experienced energy engineer and analysis of your electrical circuits, a number of alerts have been set-up to guide you towards reducing energy by eliminating waste. When a threshold is breached, an alert will be sent to the appropriate person, usually a member of the night team or the Maintenance Manager. Sometimes Responsible Power’s Energy Engineers will employ High Consumption Alerts during the day-time; particular is stubbornly high power loads are seen without adequate explanation being available for them.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">All of the alerts sent to the hotel are displayed within this table. Information is supplied regarding the date and time, the function group that has breached the threshold and some supplementary information which should enable identification of the electrical items as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The receiver of the alert should respond to the alert (normally via email) and the response is also recorded within this table.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: center;" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image6.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-41237" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image6-300x97.png" alt="image6" width="513" height="166" /></a></p>

<h4 class="western">Weather Information</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The weather has a big effect on the electricity consumption and therefore the outside temperature is displayed within the portal to allow you to analyse the electrical consumption along with the heating or cooling that may be required. It is expected that hotel heating will increase on cold days and cooling may be required on warmer days.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: center;" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/logo7a.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-41241" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/logo7a-300x78.png" alt="logo7a" width="500" height="130" /></a></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: center;" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image8.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-41238" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image8-300x78.png" alt="image8" width="504" height="131" /></a></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER">By deselecting the Average Temperature you can visually explore the ‘Need for Heating’ and ‘Need for Cooling’ which are displayed as pure numbers, see below.</p>
<p class="western">On days where more heat is required your energy costs will be higher than when less heat is needed and by the same theory, when more cooling is needed to maintain acceptable conditions for you guests you will expend more energy to achieve those. It is perfectly possible to need heating and cooling on the same day as a cold morning may lead to a warm afternoon. This is powerful data and necessary to understand your Energy Costs.</p>
<p class="western">The data is available in tabular form should you wish to refer to that instead. Like all of our widgets these are collapsible by clicking on their title should you have no requirement to view the detail within them.</p>
<p class="western">Other useful functions include:</p>
<p class="western"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/help.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41242" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/help.png" alt="help" width="25" height="24" /></a></p>
<p class="western">Help Text under the .</p>
<p class="western">The ability to search for a specific Date Range via the fields at the top of the portal page:</p>
<p class="western"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image12.png"><img class="wp-image-41243 aligncenter" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image12-300x48.png" alt="image12" width="425" height="68" /></a></p>
The ‘PDF’ button exports a copy of the entire page should you require it for an off-line meeting etc.
<h4 class="western">Hotel Actions</h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A Responsible Power Energy Engineer will visit your hotel to help you identify where upgrades, repairs and new additions to the hotel could help the hotel use electricity more efficiently and reduce the overall energy consumption. These observations and actions are displayed within this table. These Actions are the</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: center;" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image11.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-41248" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image11-300x128.png" alt="image11" width="450" height="192" /></a></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The order of these Actions can be manipulated by Department/Where, Annual Saving, Priority (PN) and RefID.
RefID is unique and the Annual Saving indicates what the annual electricity saving will be when the Action is successfully completed.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">To view the detail behind each Observation or Action click the pencil icon, ,on the Right hand side. This will open a fresh Widget immediately above the table you selected it from.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Within the details widget there is an option to view any supporting evidence; normally pictures to guide you to the issue or graphs highlighting the trend we wish to have altered. This is accessed via the Images Tab</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image13.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-41244" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image13-300x108.png" alt="image13" width="300" height="108" /></a></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">after you have selected the pencil icon,</p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: center;" align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/plus.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41247" src="http://www.creativecloudgroup.net/eval/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/plus.png" alt="plus" width="46" height="50" /></a></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">To provide an update on an Observation or Action select the plus icon, , to the Left hand side of that record. A field will appear that allows you to enter an update and alter the status of the Action if so required.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We will supply a set of valid Statuses and a Flow Chart to assist you. Should you require assistance from responsible Power then the status of ‘RP-Assist’ should be selected; this will be flagged with a Responsible Power Engineer who will assist where required.</p>

<h4 class="western"></h4>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Responsible Power will review all records that are set to ‘Complete’ and set the to RP-Closed if we agree and data supports that decision. Where there is insufficient evidence within consumption data or an action has been mis-interpreted we may Re-Open and action for the Hotel to continue resolving that particular situation.</p>
